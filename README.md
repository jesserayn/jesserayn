ðŸ˜» Hey hey! I'm Jesse Ray Nichols  
I'm playing very a seriously a game of understanding the roots of computation through philosophy and programming, with a dash of physics.  
I was drawn to virtual reality through The Matrix (1999).
I'm now learning to build experiences by focusing on design of programs, epistemology, and computer science.  

I've studied philosophy and phyics through the work of physicist David Deutsch, the pioneer of quantum computation and constructor theory, who was inspired by
the philosopher of science Karl Popper.   I love film and computer games, and wish to merge to two into the new medium of virtual reality.
