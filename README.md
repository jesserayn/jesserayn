ðŸ˜» Hey hey! I'm Jesse Ray Nichols.
I'm playing very an infinite game of understanding the roots of computation through philosophy, programming, and a bit of physics.  
I was drawn to virtual reality through The Matrix (1999) as a kid. 
I'm now learning to build experiences by focusing on the design of programs, epistemology, and computer science.  

I enjoy the thinking of the physicist David Deutsch, the pioneer of quantum computation and constructor theory, who was inspired by
the philosopher of science Karl Popper. I love film and computer games, and wish to merge with my work in virtual reality.
